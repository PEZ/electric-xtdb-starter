## Using Calva?

If you are using Calva you can start the app like this instead:

0. Open the project in VS Code
1. Issue the command **Calva: Start a Project REPL and Connect (a.k.a Jack-in)

When "ðŸ‘‰ App server available at http://0.0.0.0:8080" is printed in the Calva output/REPL window, you can control/cmd-click it and Calva will be connected both to the server and the client parts of the app.
